In summary, it generates a metadata dataframe (like above) that summarize everything using one line `TEF.dfmeta`. It also include a few one line function that you can 



- `auto_set_dtypes`
- `plot_1var`: plot univariate plots for every columns
- `fit`: fit default machine learning models by doing everything with default setting



With these, you can generate a metadata dataframe in another file as a data dictionary, with variable descriptions, feature importance of your trained model and a quick summary plot. See quick start in my blog for more detail.
